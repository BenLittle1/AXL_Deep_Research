differentiation

Cloud9’s integration of differential privacy, federated learning, and continuous PII monitoring in our SAGE engine creates defensible technology and a compelling moat.

Dual-Tech Platform (DP + FL)
What: Combines DP’s noise-based privacy with FL’s decentralized training, enabling secure, collaborative AI without raw data sharing.
Edge: Unlike single-tech solutions (e.g., anonymization tools or centralized AI platforms), Cloud9 offers both privacy and scalability—e.g., trains models across 1,000 nodes with <0.01% re-identification risk.
Quantifiable Privacy Metrics
What: Delivers dynamic risk scores (e.g., ε = 1.0, re-identification odds) for every insight or model.
Edge: Competitors lack this precision—Cloud9’s metrics prove compliance and build client confidence (e.g., “95% GDPR-safe”).

Scalable Deployment
What: APIs and edge-device integration for rapid rollout across industries (e.g., IoT, telecom).
Edge: Faster setup (e.g., 2 weeks vs. months for custom solutions) beats slow-moving enterprise competitors.
