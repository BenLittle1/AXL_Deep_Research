SECTION 1: COMPANY OVERVIEW


Company Information


Q: Company Name

A: CORDAX



Concept Summary


Q: What problem are you solving? For who? What is the result?

A: Residential general contractors and custom-home builders waste significant time and budget on manual MEP design, causing 30% schedule overruns, 12% budget overruns and 70% of work costs in rework. CORDAX eliminates these inefficiencies by auto-generating fully annotated, code-compliant MEP drawings in under three minutes, dramatically reducing errors, delays and coordination overhead.



Q: What is the industry or sector categorization?

A: Construction technology, specifically AI-powered MEP design automation for residential building projects.



Q: Is anyone else doing this? How are you different?

A: Traditional manual MEP design firms, generic CAD/BIM software and emerging PropTech startups. Unlike any competitor, CORDAX delivers fully automated, code-compliant multi-trade routing in under three minutes and eliminates 99% of rework, making us the first mover in residential MEP automation.



Company Details


Q: Is this a founder-led idea, corporate initiative, or based on existing IP?

A: Founder-driven, born from firsthand observation of chronic MEP rework and delays on residential jobsites, leveraging proprietary AI algorithms developed in-house. Currently incorporated in Ontario (April 2025).



Q: What have you accomplished to date (idea, concept, actively developing, scaling, etc.)?

A: Built an internal MVP showcased via a live micro-demo dashboard, achieved sub-3-minute processing, and integrated federal and provincial code libraries. Closed 3 paid pilots and secured 34 LOIs to validate demand.



Q: Do you have any preliminary traction or purchase intent from existing or prospective customers?

A: Three paid pilots, 34 letters of intent and 128 newsletter sign-ups from general contractors and home builders, plus enthusiastic industry quotes affirming our value.



Q: Are you Toronto-based or willing to move to Toronto to develop this idea?

A: Based in Toronto, Canada, with full commitment to the local ecosystem and openness to strategic relocation.





SECTION 2: BUSINESS PROPOSAL


Customer


Q: Who has this problem? What is the market size of the solution?

A: Ontario custom-home builders and their subcontractors (MEP contractors and general contractors), representing a $XX billion annual market (TAM/SAM/SOM outlined).



Q: Who is the ideal customer? Sector, size, problem, people, frequency.

A: Custom-home builders in Ontario completing 20–50 residential projects per year, facing high rework costs and permitting delays, and seeking faster, more reliable MEP design.



Q: Who is not the ideal customer? What do you run away from?

A: Large commercial contractors with enterprise MEP teams or small renovations without formal MEP requirements, as their workflows differ significantly from our residential focus.



Value Proposition


Q: Is there a quantifiable value proposition? What is it?

A: Delivers 99% rework elimination, reduces permitting-to-installation time by up to 80%, and cuts MEP drawing turnaround from weeks to under three minutes, saving over 2 billion work hours annually in North America.



Q: How often (frequency) does your user have the problem? How intense is the problem?

A: MEP rework occurs on nearly every custom-home project, contributing to 70% of design costs and causing 30% more schedule overruns (slides 6).



Q: How will they know if your product has solved the problem?

A: Customers measure success by percentage reduction in rework, speed of permit approvals, on-time completion rates and overall project cost savings.



Feature Set


Q: What is the MVP? Do you have a feature development roadmap?

A: The MVP is a web-based platform that imports architectural drawings and auto-generates fully annotated, code-compliant MEP sets in under three minutes, with a public beta planned next quarter.



Q: Who will use the first 'bad' product? Are they paying customers, partners, free users?

A: Early adopters are Ontario general contractors and custom-home builders participating in paid pilots, each paying for pilot projects and providing implementation feedback.



Q: Does your product actually solve the problem? How and why not?

A: Testimonials and LOIs from industry professionals confirm the solution addresses chronic coordination errors and rework headaches, demonstrating strong problem-solution fit.



Business Model


Q: Who is your early customer? How do you know them?

A: Ontario custom-home builders already in pilot programs are the easiest to convert, given their immediate rework pain and direct pipeline from our GTM strategy.



Q: What is your pricing model? How do you price your product?

A: Hybrid pricing combines a fixed monthly subscription with a variable fee based on project square footage, aligning cost with delivered value and ensuring scalable revenue.



Q: Who are your buyers? How do you know them?

A: Economic buyers are general contractors and home builders overseeing design budgets; they conduct ROI analyses on rework reduction and speed gains, choosing CORDAX for predictable, fast MEP deliverables.
