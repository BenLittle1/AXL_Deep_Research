AI-driven qualitative market research and customer insights platform
Industry Commentary

Pitch deck cites a $25 billion global spend on customer interviews in 2024 (slide 2), neatly positioning the market opportunity. Consider breaking out adjacent segments like UX research SaaS to highlight total possible runway.
Problem Statement

Product and UX teams, startups, and organizations struggle to conduct qualitative customer interviews at scale because traditional methods are slow, manual, and costly—delivering insights too late to inform fast-moving product decisions.
Problem Statement Commentary

The deck clearly contrasts slow, agency-led interviews with satellica’s automated approach (slide 3). You could strengthen this by adding a specific customer anecdote or time lost in typical workflows to make the problem even more tangible.
–
Competitors

Existing players include traditional research agencies, in-house UX teams, and SaaS research tools that still require manual moderation. Satellica differentiates as the first AI-native platform offering fully automated, decision-ready interviews end-to-end.
Competitor Commentary

Slide 9’s matrix comparison is a strong foundation, showing how no dominant AI-native competitors exist. You could name a couple of recognizable SaaS tools investors know to sharpen the contrast.

Live demo slide (slide 5) shows a polished interface and full workflow. You could add data on internal beta tests or demo outcomes to illustrate robustness.
Traction

Traction Commentary

The deck doesn’t yet show customer pilots or paid trials. Consider securing a few early adopter commitments or qualitative testimonials to demonstrate demand.
–
Location

Location Commentary

Location details aren’t provided in the pitch deck. Confirm whether Satellica is based in Toronto or open to relocation to reinforce ecosystem commitment.
Target Audience

Startups, product and UX teams, and cultural organizations seeking fast, scalable qualitative insights. Targeting a serviceable available market of $10 billion within a $25 billion TAM (slide 8).
Target Audience Commentary

Slide 7 outlines client segments and slide 8 quantifies TAM/SAM/SOM. You could refine psychographic traits (e.g., innovation-driven teams) for sharper targeting.
–
Ideal Customer

Early-stage and growth-stage startups or mid-market enterprises with dedicated product/UX functions that conduct 10–100 interviews per product cycle and need faster, cost-effective insights.
Ideal Customer Commentary

Slide 7’s segmentation is a great start. Adding typical company sizes (employee count or revenue) and annual research budgets would sharpen the profile.
Non Ideal Customer

Non Ideal Customer Commentary

You’ve clearly identified the non-ideal customers—teams that skip customer research, lean on assumptions or industry expertise alone, and those resistant to AI-driven workflows. That directly answers who you’d run away from. To strengthen this, you could briefly describe a contrasting ideal customer profile or add a concrete example of a team that struggled without research and AI adoption. That would make your differentiation even more compelling. 
–
Quantifiable Value

Delivers qualitative insights 10× faster, reduces cost per session from ~$1,583 (agency) to ~$90 (Satellica), and scales participant reach globally in local languages.
Quantifiable Value Commentary

The cost comparison (slide 11) and feature claims on slide 6 powerfully quantify savings. You could include projected ROI figures for typical customer cohorts.
Problem Frequency

Problem Frequency Commentary

You’ve clearly articulated that high-growth teams speak with customers on a weekly cadence and that enterprise groups run thousands of interviews annually, which nails the frequency part. You’ve also flagged that time and bandwidth constraints are top blockers—nice start on intensity. To deepen your answer, you could paint a stronger picture of how painful those blockers are (for example, by mentioning how long, on average, interviews get delayed or the business impact of missing insights). That extra detail will bring the intensity of the problem into sharper focus.
Success Metrics

Customers measure success by time-to-insight (targeting under 24 hours), cost per session reduction, number of follow-up questions handled automatically, and volume of qualitative feedback delivered.
Success Metrics Commentary

Slide 6 highlights speed and scale metrics. Adding a slide with typical KPI improvements (e.g., 50% boost in UX roadmap velocity) would resonate with investors.

problem_fit

Our cost-comparison and speed metrics directly address the pain of slow, costly research—evidenced by a 90% cost reduction and 10× faster insights in internal tests.
problem_fit_commentary

Slide 11’s table is a solid proof point. You might collect and share quotes from internal or beta testers to further validate fit.
early_customers

early_customers_commentary

You’ve clearly defined your beachhead segment—fast-growing start-ups and SMBs needing continuous insights—and explained that you’ve directly engaged with them through interviews and co-design sessions. That gives strong evidence you understand their needs. To make this even more compelling, you could name a few representative companies (or cite the number of engagements) and share a brief customer quote or qualitative insight. Providing a bit more detail on those early collaborations will further validate your go-to-market approach.
–
pricing

pricing_commentary

You’ve done a solid job describing a tiered SaaS approach with flexible options and a clear price band. Your mention of pay-as-you-go, Starter, Pro and Enterprise plans gives a good framework, and noting that you’ll iterate based on customer feedback shows adaptability.

You could strengthen this further by sharing ballpark figures for each tier or the per-unit cost behind your pay-as-you-go option. That extra layer of detail helps investors understand the unit economics and how usage drives revenue.
buyers

Economic buyers are Product and UX leaders who control research budgets and value rapid, data-driven decision support enabled by full automation.
buyers_commentary

You’ve identified product/UX teams as users; next, quantify typical budget owners (e.g., VP of Product) and their procurement cycle to strengthen your go-to-market plan.

role_commentary

Current roles are clear from slide 12. You could map out when you’ll transition to CEO/CTO titles and hire your first C-level execs to show leadership evolution.
team_growth

team_growth_commentary

You’ve clearly listed five key roles—two engineers, a GTM specialist, a sales/customer success hire, and a product designer—which directly answers the question in a concise, structured way. To strengthen your plan, you could clarify the specific expertise or seniority level you’d look for in each engineer (e.g., frontend vs. backend) and outline the primary responsibilities for the GTM specialist and sales/customer success hire. This will help investors understand how each hire will drive the business forward.
–
axl_support

axl_support_commentary

This answer is clear, concise, and provides specific ways AXL can help—enterprise intros to key decision-makers, guidance on positioning for scale, GTM strategy refinement, and technical advisory for AI infrastructure. You could strengthen it further by naming a few target organizations or roles you’d like intros to, and by outlining any immediate infrastructure challenges to give AXL even more context.
tech_resources

tech_resources_commentary

You’ve given a clear, concise answer that your needs are light and you’re mainly looking for high-level guidance on infrastructure best practices and occasional scaling feedback. To strengthen your response, you could quantify what “occasional” means (e.g., 2–3 reviews per quarter) and briefly mention any specific technologies or areas (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS cost optimization) where you’d welcome input. That extra detail helps AXL plan and allocate the right resources.
business_support

business_support_commentary

Great, your answer clearly confirms you’re seeking support in business development and market validation, and you’ve outlined the areas where you’d value AXL’s help (go-to-market strategy, channel partnerships, pilot opportunities). To make it even stronger, you could mention a couple of current challenges you’re facing or specific types of partners you’re targeting, which would help AXL tailor their support more precisely.
–
founder_timing

founder_timing_commentary

AXL is really interested in your deep domain expertise and the personal motivation driving you at exactly the right time. You’ve clearly shown that you’ve lived the pain of slow, fragmented research processes and that you bring both domain depth and hands-on execution experience. To make this even stronger, you could call out a specific milestone or metric from your past work—like how you streamlined a process for a team or led a successful research initiative—to give concrete proof of your track record. That will reinforce why you, above all others, are uniquely positioned to tackle this now.
market_timing

market_timing_commentary

This answer clearly explains the shifts driving your launch timing: the move from agency-led to in-house research, the rise of AI-fueled continuous insights, and the resulting gap in infrastructure. You’ve pinpointed why traditional workflows fall short and tied it to growing pain points. To strengthen it further, you could sprinkle in a bit more quantifiable market data—like growth rates or projected spend on AI research tools—and perhaps cite a concrete example of a team struggling with current solutions. This will make your timing rationale even more compelling.
differentiation
