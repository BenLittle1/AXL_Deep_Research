A: Biotechs that we've met through our extensive networks





SECTION 3: PARTNERSHIP WITH AXL


Why You?


Q: Why are you the best person to turn this idea into a billion-dollar company?

A: Our team brings a rare, multi-dimensional understanding of the problem—we’ve lived it as clinician, scientist, patient and caregiver. CEO Dr. Ian Taylor combines 20+ years in healthcare data with firsthand caregiver experience navigating fragmented medical systems. CTO Dr. Kareem Kudus, a clinical AI expert, has worked at the intersection of patient care and machine learning. This lived experience gives us unique insight into the pain patients and providers face—something competitors often miss. Both founders are full-time and committed. We’ve already secured a $4.5M pharma contract and a partnership with Providence Health (5M+ patients), proving both product–market fit and execution. Our advisors include pharma executives, clinical researchers, and seasoned tech entrepreneurs, giving us privileged access and strategic guidance. We’re not just solving a market problem—we’re solving a human one, and we’ve built the right team, tools, and traction to do it at scale.



Q: What role do you see yourself playing at the company moving forward?

A: Using the skills I've built through over a decade working with data, including a PhD in AI applied to medicine, I will lead out tech development



Q: Who are your first 5 ideal hires?

A: We have already made them! Developers and product/design experts.



Why Us?


Q: What can AXL do to best support the development of your idea?

A: Deep ties into the toronto tech ecosystem that can help us accelerate our progress



Q: How intensive do you believe your idea will be on AXL's technical team? Be as specific as possible.

A: We would rely on AXL more for advice and strategy, rather than technical work hours, which we can cover with our internal resources



Q: Are you looking for support on the business development and market validation process?

A: Yes, we have some traction but certainly could use more.



Why Now?


Q: You have lots of options. Why are you the right person to do this now?

A: We have the connections, business model and the time is right: our strategy requires ai agents that are able to act autonomously to collect medical data, this has only just become possible. Additionally, recruiting for clinical trials is only becoming slower and more expensive, so our potential customers are looking for solutions.



Q: What has changed in the market to make this the right time to launch your solution?

A: Increasing biotech R&D investment, growing trial complexities, patient-centered research focus, and new LLM technologies converge to create urgent demand



Q: How will this idea stay ahead or stay differentiated long enough to become the market leader?

A: Transparent patient compensation model, proprietary AI-driven data normalization for high-quality matching, and network effects that grow stronger as participation increases

Clinical trial recruitment technology and biotech data management
Industry Commentary

You’ve pinpointed a recognized industry—clinical trial recruitment and biotech data management—and backed it with market projections ($84B by 2027 on slide 11). This framing resonates with investors familiar with the space.
Problem Statement

Pharma and biotech companies struggle to recruit patients for clinical trials quickly and cost-effectively due to fragmented patient data and a doctor-centric model. Average enrollment times have ballooned from 13 months in 2013 to 24 months in 2024, driving up costs, delaying critical drug development, and negatively impacting patient outcomes.
Problem Statement Commentary

The pitch deck clearly outlines the recruitment bottleneck in clinical trials and quantifies the impact with enrollment times and costs (slide 3). You’ve strengthened this by naming pharma and biotech as the target, and highlighting downstream patient benefits. Consider weaving in a brief patient-side perspective to underscore urgency.
