# 🎯 NEW ENTRY PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Overview
The enhanced system now intelligently detects **only NEW companies** that haven't been processed yet, preventing duplicate work and ensuring efficiency.

## 🔍 How Detection Works

### 1. **Multi-Column Detection**
The system checks multiple columns to determine if a company has already been processed:

- `Processed` (any variation: "processed", "processing_status")
- `Reports_Generated` / `Timestamp` 
- `One-Pager` (report-specific tracking)
- `Deep-Dive` (report-specific tracking)
- Any column with "timestamp", "date_processed", "last_updated"

### 2. **Status-Based Filtering**
Companies are **only processed** if their Status is one of:
- `Pending`
- `Reviewed - Promising` 
- `Ready`
- `New`
- `To Process`

### 3. **Processing Indicators**
A company is considered **already processed** if ANY of these conditions are met:

**Exact Matches:**
- `yes`, `true`, `✓`, `processed`, `completed`, `done`, `success`

**Partial Matches:**
- Contains `✓` anywhere in the value
- Contains `processed` in the text
- Contains `generated` in the text

## 📊 What You'll See

## 📋 Google Sheet Setup Recommendations

### Required Columns:
- `company_name` - Company name (required)
- `Status` - Processing status (required)

### Recommended Tracking Columns:
- `Processed` - Overall processing status
- `One-Pager` - One-pager report status  
- `Deep-Dive` - Deep-dive report status
- `Timestamp` - When processing completed
- `Error` - Error messages if processing failed

### Example Status Values:

**Before Processing:**
- Status: `Pending` or `Reviewed - Promising`
- Processed: (empty)
- One-Pager: (empty)
- Deep-Dive: (empty)

**After Successful Processing:**
- Status: `Pending` (unchanged)
- Processed: `✅ Processed (2025-01-10 15:30:45)`
- One-Pager: `✅ Generated 2025-01-10 15:30:45`
- Deep-Dive: `✅ Generated 2025-01-10 15:30:45`

**After Failed Processing:**
- Status: `Pending` (unchanged)
- Processed: `❌ Failed (2025-01-10 15:30:45)`
- Error: `Failed to generate any reports`

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Add new companies** to your Google Sheet with Status = `Pending`
2. **Leave tracking columns empty** (Processed, One-Pager, Deep-Dive)
3. **Run processing**: `POST /google-sheets-process`
4. **System automatically**:
   - Finds only NEW companies
   - Processes them with AI agents
   - Updates tracking columns
   - Skips already-processed companies

## 🔧 API Endpoints

- **Process New Companies**: `POST /google-sheets-process`
- **Check Sheet Status**: `GET /google-sheets-info/{sheet_id}`

The system is now **smart and efficient** - it will only process truly new entries! 🎯
