# üìã Extremely Detailed Google Sheets Automation Setup

## üéØ What We're Building

```
Your AirTable ‚Üí Google Sheets ‚Üí Your Report System ‚Üí PDF Reports
     (existing)     (existing)        (new part)        (existing)
```

When AirTable marks a company as "promising", it adds a row to your Google Sheet. Our new system will:
1. Read companies from that Google Sheet
2. Generate reports for unprocessed companies
3. Mark them as processed in the sheet

## üìù Prerequisites Checklist

Before we start, make sure you have:
- [ ] Your existing Google Sheet that AirTable writes to
- [ ] Access to Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Your existing backend system running
- [ ] Terminal/command line access

## üîß Part 1: Google Cloud Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1.3: Create Service Account

1. **In the left sidebar**, click "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. **Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS"** (blue button at the top)
3. **Select "Service account"** from the dropdown
4. **Fill out Service account details:**
   - Service account name: `axl-sheets-automation`
   - Service account ID: (auto-filled, leave as is)
   - Description: `Service account for AXL report generation from Google Sheets`
5. **Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"**
6. **Grant service account access:**
   - Role: Click the dropdown and search for "Editor"
   - Select "Editor" (gives read/write access to everything)
   - Click "CONTINUE"
7. **Grant users access:** Skip this step, click "DONE"

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You should see your new service account in the credentials list

### Step 1.4: Create and Download Service Account Key

1. **Find your service account** in the credentials list (should be the one you just created)
2. **Click on the service account name** (not the email, the name)
3. **Go to the "Keys" tab**
4. **Click "ADD KEY"** ‚Üí "Create new key"
5. **Select "JSON"** format
6. **Click "CREATE"**
7. **A JSON file will download automatically** - this is your credentials file!
8. **IMPORTANT:** Move this file to a secure location and remember where it is

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You should have a JSON file downloaded (something like `axl-sheets-automation-abc123.json`)

### Step 1.5: Note Your Service Account Email

1. **Look at the JSON file you just downloaded** (open it in a text editor)
2. **Find the "client_email" field** - it looks like: `axl-sheets-automation@your-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. **Copy this email address** - you'll need it in the next part

## üóÇÔ∏è Part 2: Google Sheets Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Open Your Existing Google Sheet

1. **Open your existing Google Sheet** that AirTable writes to
2. **Look at the column structure** - we need to understand what columns you have

### Step 2.2: Check/Add Required Columns

Your sheet needs these columns (add them if missing):

**Required columns:**
- `Company Name` (AirTable probably creates this)
- `Status` (AirTable probably sets this to "Reviewed - Promising")

**Optional but helpful columns:**
- `Website` or `Company URL`
- `Pitch Deck Content` or `Pitch Deck Notes`
- `Internal Notes` or `Notes`

**Columns our system will add/update:**
- `Processed` (we'll mark as "‚úì Processed" or "‚ùå Failed")
- `Reports Generated` (timestamp when we process)
- `Error` (error message if processing fails)

**To add missing columns:**
1. **Right-click on any column header**
2. **Select "Insert 1 right"**
3. **Type the column name** in the new header cell
4. **Repeat for each missing column**

### Step 2.3: Share Sheet with Service Account

1. **Click the "Share" button** (top right of your Google Sheet)
2. **In the "Add people and groups" field**, paste the service account email you copied earlier
3. **Change permission to "Editor"** (click the pencil icon dropdown)
4. **Uncheck "Notify people"** (we don't want to spam the service account)
5. **Click "Share"**

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** The service account email should appear in the sheet's sharing list

### Step 2.4: Get Your Sheet ID

1. **Look at the URL of your Google Sheet**
2. **Find the sheet ID** - it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/edit`
   - Sheet ID: `1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms`
3. **Copy this sheet ID** - you'll need it for configuration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 3: Backend Configuration (10 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Install Dependencies

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/benlittle/Desktop/Stuff/Projects/AXL/AXL_Ventures_Deep_Research/startup-report-generator/backend
   ```
3. **Install new dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Wait for installation** (1-2 minutes)

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** No error messages, installation completes successfully

### Step 3.2: Create Environment Configuration

1. **In the backend directory**, copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp environment_template.txt .env
   ```
2. **Open the .env file** in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   # or use VS Code, TextEdit, etc.
   ```

### Step 3.3: Configure Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file with your actual values:

```bash
# ==============================================
# AI API Configuration (keep your existing values)
# ==============================================
AI_API_KEY=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
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=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
AI_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions

# ==============================================
# Google Sheets Integration (NEW - add these)
# ==============================================
# OPTION 1: Put the full JSON content here (recommended for production)
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-123456","private_key_id":"abc123...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhki...","client_email":"axl-sheets-automation@your-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/axl-sheets-automation%40your-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}

# OPTION 2: OR point to the JSON file (easier for local development)
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=google_sheets_credentials.json

# Your Google Sheet details
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms
GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_NAME=Sheet1

# ==============================================
# Application Configuration
# ==============================================
PORT=8000
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
```

**For the credentials, choose ONE option:**

**Option A (Easier for local testing):** 
1. Copy your downloaded JSON file to the backend directory
2. Rename it to `google_sheets_credentials.json`
3. Use the `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE` option

**Option B (Better for production):**
1. Open your downloaded JSON file
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents (it's one long line)
3. Paste it as the value for `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`

**Replace these placeholders:**
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`: Your actual sheet ID from Step 2.4
- `GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_NAME`: Usually "Sheet1", but check your sheet's tab name

### Step 3.4: Save the Configuration

1. **Save the .env file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. **Make sure it's saved in the backend directory**

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Your .env file exists and has all the values filled in

## üß™ Part 4: Testing (15 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Start Your Backend

1. **In Terminal, from the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
2. **You should see:**
   ```
   INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/path/to/backend']
   INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   INFO:     Started reloader process [12345] using WatchFiles
   INFO:     Started server process [12346]
   INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
   INFO:     Application startup complete.
   ```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Server starts without errors

### Step 4.2: Test Basic Connectivity

1. **Open a new Terminal window** (keep the server running in the first one)
2. **Test the health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
3. **You should see:**
   ```json
   {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"}
   ```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Health check returns successfully

### Step 4.3: Test Google Sheets Connectivity

1. **Test sheet info** (replace `YOUR_SHEET_ID` with your actual sheet ID):
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-info/YOUR_SHEET_ID?worksheet_name=Sheet1"
   ```
2. **You should see something like:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "sheet_info": {
       "sheet_title": "AXL Company Pipeline",
       "worksheet_title": "Sheet1",
       "row_count": 10,
       "col_count": 8
     },
     "pending_companies": 2,
     "timestamp": "2024-01-15 10:30:00"
   }
   ```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You can successfully read your Google Sheet

**If you get an error:**
- Check that the sheet ID is correct
- Verify the service account has access to the sheet
- Make sure your credentials are correct in the .env file

### Step 4.4: Add Test Data to Your Sheet

1. **Go to your Google Sheet**
2. **Add a test company row** with these values:
   - Company Name: `Test Company`
   - Status: `Reviewed - Promising` (or whatever status you use)
   - Website: `https://example.com`
   - Pitch Deck Content: `This is a test company for automation`
   - Internal Notes: `Testing our new automation system`
   - Processed: (leave empty)
   - Reports Generated: (leave empty)
   - Error: (leave empty)

### Step 4.5: Test Processing

1. **Run the processing command:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-process" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "sheet_id": "YOUR_SHEET_ID",
       "worksheet_name": "Sheet1"
     }'
   ```
2. **You should see detailed output** in both:
   - The terminal running your server (lots of processing logs)
   - The curl response (JSON with processing results)

3. **Check your Google Sheet** - the test company row should now have:
   - Processed: `‚úì Processed`
   - Reports Generated: (timestamp)

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Test company gets processed successfully

## üöÄ Part 5: Production Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 5.1: Set Up Scheduled Processing

You can process companies automatically using several methods:

**Option A: Manual Processing (Recommended to start)**
Just run the curl command whenever you want to process new companies:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-process" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sheet_id": "YOUR_SHEET_ID", "worksheet_name": "Sheet1"}'
```

**Option B: Scheduled with cron (Unix/Mac/Linux)**
1. **Open crontab:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. **Add this line** (runs every hour):
   ```bash
   0 * * * * curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-process" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sheet_id":"YOUR_SHEET_ID","worksheet_name":"Sheet1"}' >> /tmp/axl-processing.log 2>&1
   ```

**Option C: GitHub Actions (if your code is on GitHub)**
Create `.github/workflows/process-companies.yml`:
```yaml
name: Process Companies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Process Companies
        run: |
          curl -X POST "${{ secrets.API_URL }}/google-sheets-process" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"sheet_id":"${{ secrets.SHEET_ID }}","worksheet_name":"Sheet1"}'
```

### Step 5.2: Deploy to Production

**For Railway deployment:**
1. **Push your code** to GitHub
2. **Connect Railway** to your repo
3. **Add environment variables** in Railway dashboard:
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS` (the full JSON)
   - `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_NAME`
   - All your existing variables

**For local production:**
1. **Use a process manager** like PM2:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000" --name axl-backend
   ```

## üîç Part 6: Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "Google Sheets credentials not found"**
- Check your `.env` file has the correct credentials
- Verify JSON format is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Make sure the file path is correct if using file option

**2. "Failed to connect to Google Sheet"**
- Verify sheet ID is correct (copy from URL)
- Check that service account email has Editor access
- Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled

**3. "No pending companies found"**
- Check companies have status "Pending" or "Reviewed - Promising"
- Verify "Processed" column is empty for those companies
- Check column names match expected format

**4. Processing fails**
- Check your Perplexity API key is valid
- Verify you have sufficient API credits
- Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Monitoring Commands

**Check sheet status:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-info/YOUR_SHEET_ID"
```

**Check server logs:**
```bash
# If running with uvicorn directly, logs appear in terminal
# If using PM2:
pm2 logs axl-backend
```

**Check processing results:**
The Google Sheet itself shows the status of each company.

## üéØ Part 7: Understanding the Workflow

### How It Works Daily

1. **AirTable marks company as promising** ‚Üí Automatically adds to Google Sheet
2. **Your scheduled process runs** (hourly/daily) ‚Üí Checks for new companies
3. **System processes each company:**
   - Runs research agent (gathers data)
   - Runs formatting agent (creates reports)
   - Generates PDF files
   - Updates Google Sheet with status
4. **You review results** in Google Sheet and generated reports

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Full visibility**: See all companies and their status
- ‚úÖ **Error tracking**: Failed processes show error messages
- ‚úÖ **Batch processing**: Handle multiple companies at once
- ‚úÖ **Manual control**: Process on-demand when needed
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail**: Timestamps show when processing happened

## üö® Emergency Procedures

**If something breaks:**

1. **Check the Google Sheet** - does it show error messages?
2. **Check server logs** - what error messages appear?
3. **Test connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
   curl "http://localhost:8000/google-sheets-info/YOUR_SHEET_ID"
   ```
4. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # If running directly:
   Ctrl+C to stop, then: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   
   # If using PM2:
   pm2 restart axl-backend
   ```

**If you need to reprocess a company:**
1. Clear the "Processed" column for that company in Google Sheets
2. Run the processing command again

## üéâ You're Done!

Your Google Sheets automation is now fully set up! The system will:

1. ‚úÖ Read companies from your existing Google Sheet
2. ‚úÖ Process them through your AI research system
3. ‚úÖ Generate professional PDF reports
4. ‚úÖ Track status and errors in the sheet
5. ‚úÖ Run automatically on your chosen schedule

**Next steps:**
- Add some real companies to test with
- Set up your preferred scheduling method
- Monitor the first few runs to ensure everything works smoothly
- Deploy to production when ready
